# Cloud Automation with Ansible

## Overview
I created this project to demonstrate how I can automate cloud infrastructure provisioning and management using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). Ansible is my go-to open-source automation tool for simplifying configuration management, application deployment, and task automation across servers and cloud environments.

## Features
- I can automate cloud resource provisioning
- I manage infrastructure as code
- I use reusable and modular playbooks
- I easily integrate with various cloud providers

## Prerequisites
Before I get started, I make sure I have:
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- Access to my preferred cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- My cloud provider credentials (API keys, secrets, etc.)

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Cloud_Automation-Ansible
   ```
   I start by cloning the repository and navigating into the project directory.
2. **Install Ansible:**
   ```bash
   pip install ansible
   ```
   I install Ansible using pip to get all the necessary automation tools.
3. **Configure my cloud credentials:**
   - I follow my cloud provider's documentation to set up credentials.
   - I export credentials as environment variables or use Ansible vault for sensitive data.

## Usage
- I place my Ansible playbooks in the project directory.
- To run a playbook, I use:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook <playbook.yml>
  ```
- For example, I might run:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook provision_infrastructure.yml
  ```
