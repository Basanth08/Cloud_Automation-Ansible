# Cloud Automation with Ansible

## Scenario
As part of the AWS Cloud Management Team, I regularly deploy and set up infrastructure on the cloud. For every new project, I make sure to use a secure and highly available (HA) VPC. I often handle regular requests for cloud resources and configurations.

## Problem
When I work with VPCs, I deal with many moving parts—subnets, NAT gateways, internet gateways, route tables, network ACLs, and security groups. I also need to set up a bastion host for secure access. If I make a mistake, it can lead to a non-functional or exposed VPC, which is a serious risk. Managing all these components manually is a time-consuming task, and I want to avoid human error as much as possible.

## Solution
To address these challenges, I use configuration management for my VPCs. By automating the setup, I eliminate human errors and ensure everything is consistent. I centralize change management, so every update is tracked and controlled. With version control and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), I can easily manage, review, and roll back changes as needed.

## Statistics: Cloud Automation in IT
By adopting cloud automation, I’ve seen significant benefits:
- 71%: I experience 10% revenue growth.
- 84%: I increase revenue and lower operations costs.
- 81%: I become more innovative in my IT practices.
- 84%: I am more agile and can respond to changes faster.

## Tool and Cloud
I rely on Ansible automation for configuration management of my VPCs. On the AWS Cloud Platform, I set up VPCs with bastion hosts to ensure secure and efficient access.

## Overview
I created this project to demonstrate how I can automate cloud infrastructure provisioning and management using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). Ansible is my go-to open-source automation tool for simplifying configuration management, application deployment, and task automation across servers and cloud environments.

## Features
- I can automate cloud resource provisioning
- I manage infrastructure as code
- I use reusable and modular playbooks
- I easily integrate with various cloud providers

## Prerequisites
Before I get started, I make sure I have:
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- Access to my preferred cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- My cloud provider credentials (API keys, secrets, etc.)

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Cloud_Automation-Ansible
   ```
   I start by cloning the repository and navigating into the project directory.
2. **Install Ansible:**
   ```bash
   pip install ansible
   ```
   I install Ansible using pip to get all the necessary automation tools.
3. **Configure my cloud credentials:**
   - I follow my cloud provider's documentation to set up credentials.
   - I export credentials as environment variables or use Ansible vault for sensitive data.

## Usage
- I place my Ansible playbooks in the project directory.
- To run a playbook, I use:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook <playbook.yml>
  ```
- For example, I might run:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook provision_infrastructure.yml
  ```

## Architecture

I have included an architecture diagram to visually represent how I automate cloud infrastructure using Ansible and AWS. You can find the diagram below:
